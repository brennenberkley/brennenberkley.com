    <h1>Condo remodel</h1>
<p>
  About 3 months ago Emily and I bought a condo in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. It's on the second floor of a 4-story building with 18 units total. Although the unit was in pretty good shape overall, there were a lot of things that hadn't been updated since the building was built in 1985. We didn't like the thin, dark wood baseboards and the big mirrored wall in the dining room. The carpet was pretty old we didn't love the color of the hardwood floors. So over the last few months we've made quite a few changes. We hired a contractor to put in the carpet, but everything else was done ourselves, with the help of a few amazing friends. 
</p>

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<h3>Floors</h3>
<p>Instead of having the hardwood flooring abruptly end at both ends of the kitchen we wanted the floor the flow though the entire house, which meant tearing up the exiting hardwood in the kitchen and entryway. That turned out to be a much bigger project than I anticipated, especially in the kitchen where the existing floor ran under the kitchen cabinets. That meant renting a special saw that could cut the floor right at the base of the cabinets. After making the cuts we could replace the floor in the center while leaving the old floor underneath the cabinets. The old floor was also real hardwood, which means it's really heavy. So hauling all of that off was a bit more troublesome than I expected.
</p>

<p>
  Once we tore out the existing baseboards, carpet, and hardwood, we discovered that the subfloor underneath those areas was not at the same level. So before we could lay down laminate flooring we had to put down plywood where the hardwood floor had been to raise it up about 3/8" and match the level of where the carpet was. In addition to that, there were several spots where the subfloor underneath the carpet was not very level, so we had to fill some spots will subfloor patch to get the entire floor as flat as possible.
</p>

<p>
  After all of the floor prep was finished, laying the new floor went fairly quickly. We were able to finish the entire floor in 2 days over a weekend. We left the existing floor in both bathrooms and the laundry room.
</p>

<h3>Baseboards and Crown Molding</h3>
<p>
  After laying down the floor we painted, cut, and installed new baseboards in most of the house. We also installed crown molding as well to make the bedrooms and common areas a bit more interesting. This was one of the most time-consuming parts of the whole project just because of how many steps there are: Paint, measure, cut, install, caulk the seams, fill the nail holes, paint over the fill.
</p>

<h3>Paint</h3>
<p>
  Painting was mostly done before the floor was installed, but like most projects it ended up taking a bit longer than we thought it would. We re-painted most of the walls an off-white and then painted the ceilings in the main room and office blue. For our bedroom we painted the ceiling purple, which I was a bit nervous about but I'm really happy with how it turned out. Almost everyone we talked to about painting the ceiling a dark color said it was a bad idea because it would look out of place or make the room look smaller, but we did it anyway and we're really happy with the results.
</p>

<h3>Mirror Trim</h3>
<p>
  We didn't love the large mirrored wall in the dining room. Part of the reason was because the mirror was actually in 3 separate panels, so there were two big seams that were very distracting. Our solution was to add trim over the top of the mirror to cover the seams and add some dimension. The process was pretty simple, we just cut each trim piece to size and then glued them strait to the mirror with liquid nails. After that dried we filled the seams with mud to make the whole thing look seamless.
</p>

<h3>Laundry Room</h3>
<p>
  The laundry room looked like it was originally configured to have the dryer opposite the door and the washer on the left, but at some point the previous owners had installed a tiny stackable washer and dryer instead, both on the left wall. Do make that work they had moved the dryer electrical outlet to the other wall and ran the dryer vent across the floor and over the water heater, which was really ugly. I had to move the dryer outlet back to its original location and take out the venting. Even the original configuration wasn't quite large enough to fit the washer and dryer we wanted though, so we ended up moving the cabinets all the way up to the ceiling and changing the door to swing out instead of in to make room. In the future we might also replace the water header with a tankless water heater, which would allow the washer and dryer to fit side by side against the left wall.
</p>

<h2>Smaller Changes</h2>
<p>There are a lot of smaller things we did along the way that I wanted to mention as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replaced light fixtures in the dining room and laundry room</li>
  <li>Replaced most of the light switches with smart switches</li>
  <li>Changed the look of the fireplace using stick-on vinyll for the tiles and a grout pen for the grout</li>
  <li>Replaced all of the gold/brass door-knobs and hinges with brushed nickel</li>
  <li>Replaced a few of the dated-looking thermostats and smoke alarms with new ones</li>
  <li>Replaced the sliding doors in the entryway with bifold doors</li>
</ul>
