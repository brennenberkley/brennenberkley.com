title:  "Can Evolution and Creationism Coexist?"

<p></p>Many creationists try to explain that evolution and creation can both be right, and that evolution was simply the tool God used when creating the earth. But if you look at the order of the creation story from Genesis, it’s not even in the same order as what we understand from  evolution so how can they both be accurate? This is the order of creation taught in Genesis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Day 1: Day and night, light and darkness</li>
  <li>Day 2: Heaven and the sky</li>
  <li>Day 3: Land and sea, plants and trees on the land</li>
  <li>Day 4: Sun, moon, and stars</li>
  <li>Day 5: Creatures that live in the sea and creatures that fly</li>
  <li>Day 6: Animals and creatures living on the land and humans</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of problems with this timeline, one being that life started in the sea around 4 billion years ago, but land-based plants only showed up 430 million years ago. But even if you include sea-based plants in day 3, the earliest fish, which would clearly be in day 5, date back to 500 million years ago while the first trees didn’t appear until 360 million years ago. So there is pretty good evidence that trees were not before sea creatures. Another  big problem is that creation claims there were trees on the earth before the sun existed. But how could that be when a vital ingredient for the growth of trees is sunlight? There is also ample evidence that the first flying creatures evolved from dinosaurs, so that conflicts with the idea that birds were created before other land creatures. I could go on, but any one of these points should be enough to throw the whole idea of evolution-driven creationism out the window. To pretend otherwise is to throw away all of science in favor of personal feelings.</p>
