<p>Do Mormons Believe in Evolution?</p>

<p>The Mormon church does not have any official stance on evolution, but from looking at the other things they believe it is pretty clear what their stance is. Let’s start with some basic things that are considered doctrine by the church:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fall of Adam happened about 6,000 years ago. This is taught in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.p7?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 77:7</a>, and if there is any question about the proper interpretation of that verse there have been multiple clarifications in official church manuals such as this excerpt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-seminary-teacher-manual-2014/section-4/lesson-82-doctrine-and-covenants-77.p23#p23">current D&C study manual</a>: “7,000 years refers to the time since the Fall of Adam and Eve”.</li>
<li>There was no death before the fall of Adam. This is made clear in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.p22?lang=eng#p22">2nd Nephi 2:22</a>, Moses 6:48, and the <a hef="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/death?lang=eng">bible dictionary</a>: “Two kinds of death are spoken of in the scriptures. One is the death of the body, which is caused by the separation of the body from the spirit; The other is spiritual death, which is to die as pertaining to, or to be separated from, righteousness—to be alienated from the things of God. Both of these deaths were introduced into the world by the Fall of Adam."</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on those two facts, one of the core doctrines of the church is that there was no death until about 6,000 years ago. I’m sure there are apologists out there who will argue that’s not what the doctrine means and it is being misinterpreted and so forth, but to make those arguments is to say that words don’t mean what they mean and the leaders of the church don’t speak for the church, at which point the church and the scriptures have no meaning. So if Mormons believe there was no death until 6,000 years ago, there is no way they can possibly believe in the theory of evolution which concludes that life on earth started billions of years ago and things have been living and dying ever since. </p>

<p>If you are a member of the church and also believe in evolution, I would love to hear your reasoning to understand better how you can believe such (in my mind) contradictory things. Although I would invite you to look through this post first: <a href="/creationism-and-evolution.html">Can Evolution and Creationism Coexist?</a></p>

<p>If you don’t believe in evolution, there’s a good chance you have a misunderstanding of what evolution actually is and isn’t, and I’ve written a separate post that you may find interesting: <a href="/evolution-misconceptions.html">Common Misconceptions About Evolution</a>. If after reading through that you still don’t believe in evolution, I again would be very interested to hear your point of view.</p>
