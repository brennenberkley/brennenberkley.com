title:  "Common Misconceptions About Evolution"

<p>Evolution is considered as fact by the scientific community, but despite the overwhelming evidence behind it many people, mostly religious people, disagree. My experience talking to these people has revealed that they often just don’t understand what evolution actually teaches, and instead have taught misrepresentations of the theory of evolution. I have outlined a few of these misconceptions below:</p>

<h4>Evolution teaches that humans evolved from monkeys. If that was true, we wouldn’t still have monkeys</h4>
<p>This is false. Evolution teaches that humans and monkeys are both primates, and we evolved from a common ancestor that lived around 7 million years ago. That common ancestor may have looked something like a monkey, but the monkeys we know today did not exist 7 million years ago.</p>

<h4>Evolution is only a theory, it has not been proven and is not accepted by all scientists</h4>

<p>The Smithsonian sums this one up pretty well: “Evolution is the cornerstone of modern biology. There is no scientific controversy about whether evolution occurred or whether it explains the history of life on Earth. As in all fields of science, knowledge about evolution continues to increase through research and serious debate.” So scientists may debate certain aspects of evolution, but no one is arguing that it didn’t happen. As far as the “theory” part of it, a definition may be helpful: “In science, a theory is the most logical explanation for how a natural phenomenon works. It is well tested and supported by abundant evidence.” A theory doesn’t become a fact once there is enough evidence, rather it is a larger body of knowledge that is supported by various facts. Gravity is also a theory, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t been proven.</p>

  <h4>If all animals evolved from other animals, why don’t we have fossils of these transitional species?</h4>

<p>We do. Tons of them. You can check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils#From_lizards_to_snakes">this wikipedia page</a> for a whole list.</p>

  <h4>Evolution only explains simple changes. How do you explain the creation of complex organs like the human eye?</h4>

<p>This comes up a lot because evolution is very slow and complex things like an eye have to evolve one tiny step at a time, and each step has to have immediate benefit to the organism. So how could an eye, something that seemingly would be useless until it is fully developed, slowly evolve over time? Well, the first “eyes” were just parts of a single cell that could detect light. They could not determine the direction of the light or make out shapes, but they could vaguely tell how much light was hitting them. Over time they make small advancements that help focus the light, and eventually develop the various pieces of the eye that make it what it is now. And they had 550 million years to do it, so each improvement could be extremely slow. You can read a more detailed explanation of this here: <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/stories/eyes-how/#:~:text=The%20first%20organisms%20with%20a,complex%20eyes%20we%20have%20today.">scienceworld.ca/stories/eyes-how</a>.</p>

  <h4>Evolution makes sense for animals, but humans were created by god in their current form.</h4>

<p>How do you draw the line between human and animal? We have ample fossil evidence of the entire evolution from small creatures up until our current human form. In addition to that, there used to be multiple species of humans before the others went extinct, such as Neanderthals. Most humans still have a small amount of Neanderthal DNA, so if they were animals how could we mate with them? If they were humans, why do they evolve to be fundamentally different than the modern humans we know today?</p>

  <p>There are a million other misconceptions people might have about evolution, it would be impossible to list them all. But ultimately, who are we to disagree with thousands of scientists who have advanced degrees in the nature of the world? To deny evolution would be to deny the entirety of biology, genetics, modern medicine, and modern agriculture.</p>
