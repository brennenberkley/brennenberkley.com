    I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed that 70 million Americans think Donald Trump is doing a good job as our president. Sure, Joe Biden won, and I’m very happy about that, but this race should not have even been close. I know all politicians lie and make promises that they can’t keep, but Trump took that to new extremes and no even cares. People have become so indoctrinated by fox news to think anything even slightly left-leaning is complete evil that they will support literally anyone else.
