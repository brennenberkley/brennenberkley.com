<p>I was raised in the LDS church and was an active member for my whole childhood. When I was 18 I moved to Albuquerque and started college, and for a few months I continued to attend church and institute classes, but it wasn’t the same as it was in Farmington. It all just felt like a waste of time, so I stopped going. I was doing well in school, was happily married, and didn’t feel like I needed the church. I never doubted the gospel and I always figured I would go back to church at some point, but as I spent more and more time away from the church I started to have a lot of questions. I was happier than ever without the gospel in my life, so I finally considered the possibility that the teachings of the LDS church aren’t true. As I searched for answers I found tons of stuff that you don’t ever learn about in church, parts of its history that the church intentionally leaves out because it would cause people to question the truth of it all. One great source of information is <a href="https://cesletter.org/Letter-to-a-CES-Director.pdf" target="blank">The CES Letter</a>, which outlines a lot of early church history from an external perspective. As I tried to justify all of the contradictions, there came a point when I could no longer ignore the huge amount of evidence against the church. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but what follows are the most significant issues that led me to leave the LDS church.
